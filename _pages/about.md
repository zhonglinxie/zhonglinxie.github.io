<!-- Welcome to my personal homepage! I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student at the [Beijing International Center for Mathematical Research](https://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](http://pku.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Zaiwen Wen](http://faculty.bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~wenzw/index.html). I am a member of the [Elite Ph.D. Program in Applied Mathematics](https://cmlr.pku.edu.cn/Graduate/ElitePhDProgram/Students/index.htm).

My research interests lie in the fields of machine learning and optimization. I am working on designing new optimization algorithms using machine learning techniques, known as Learning to Optimize (L2O). I also have a strong interest in analyzing and developing new optimization algorithms from the ODE perspective. Furthermore, I am keen on addressing problems in deep learning using tools and insights from optimization.

I received my bachelor's degree in 2021 from the [School of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/) at Peking University, majoring in computational mathematics. Additionally, I was a member of the [Elite Program of Applied Mathematics and Statistics for Undergraduates](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/amel/syscgzs/bjxskycgzs/134601.htm). I also obtained a bachelor's degree in economics from the [National School of Development](https://nsd.pku.edu.cn/) from 2018 to 2021. -->

Welcome to my personal homepage! I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student at the [Beijing International Center for Mathematical Research](https://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](http://pku.edu.cn/), under the guidance of Prof. [Zaiwen Wen](http://faculty.bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~wenzw/index.html). I am a member of the [Elite Ph.D. Program in Applied Mathematics](https://cmlr.pku.edu.cn/Graduate/ElitePhDProgram/Students/index.htm).

**My current research focus is on Large Language Models (LLMs)**, where I am particularly interested in addressing key challenges and advancing the state-of-the-art in this rapidly evolving field. My work centers around the following directions:  
- **[Data selection strategies](/assets/pdf/Data_Selection_Survey_slides.pdf)**: Investigating how to optimize training and fine-tuning processes by selecting high-quality and diverse datasets to improve model performance and efficiency.  
- **More efficient and scalable Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures**: Designing **innovative MoE structures** that balance computational cost with model capacity, enabling better scalability for large-scale models.  
- **L2O techniques in LLM scenarios**: Exploring how **Learning to Optimize (L2O)** can be applied to enhance optimization in LLM training and inference pipelines, such as adaptive learning rate scheduling and resource allocation.  

I am actively seeking opportunities to transition into the LLM industry and contribute to cutting-edge advancements in this domain. **If you are interested in my background or any of the research directions mentioned above, please feel free to contact me immediatelyâ€”I would love to connect and explore potential collaborations or opportunities!**

Previously, my research primarily focused on machine learning and optimization, with an emphasis on theoretical studies in **Learning to Optimize (L2O)**. I worked on designing novel optimization algorithms using machine learning techniques and analyzing optimization methods from the perspective of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Additionally, I explored how tools and insights from optimization could address challenges in deep learning.

I received my bachelor's degree in 2021 from the [School of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/) at Peking University, majoring in computational mathematics. During my undergraduate studies, I was also a member of the [Elite Program of Applied Mathematics and Statistics for Undergraduates](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/amel/syscgzs/bjxskycgzs/134601.htm). Additionally, I earned a second bachelor's degree in economics from the [National School of Development](https://nsd.pku.edu.cn/) between 2018 and 2021.  

Looking forward to connecting with like-minded researchers and professionals!
