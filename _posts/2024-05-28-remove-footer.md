The footer information originally included in this website's theme has been removed and may now be found within this blog post. This modification is permitted under the terms of the MIT License, which grants users the right to "use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software." I moved the footer information for simplicity, which contains the copyright notice:

> {{ site.footer_text }}
